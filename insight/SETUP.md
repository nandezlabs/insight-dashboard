## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Install Dependencies** (Required Now)

```bash
cd /Users/nandez/developer/insight

# Install Melos globally if you haven't
dart pub global activate melos

# Bootstrap the project (installs all dependencies)
melos bootstrap
```

### 2. **Set Up Supabase** (Backend)

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project (choose a region close to you)
3. Wait for database provisioning (~2 minutes)
4. Go to **Project Settings → API** and copy:
   - Project URL
   - `anon` public key

### 3. **Run Database Migration**

In your Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Create a new query
3. I'll provide you the complete SQL schema next

### 4. **Create the Apps** (Store Manager + Store)

Once Melos bootstrap completes successfully, I'll create:

- Store Manager app with Flutter
- Store app with Flutter
- Both configured for iOS, Android, and macOS
